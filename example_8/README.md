# Hook Package Demo

## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to implement and manage toggleable hooks. Hooks are a technique for inserting custom code during program execution, allowing for extension or modification of program behavior without changing the original code.

1. **Hook Mechanism Design**
   - Demonstrates how to design a simple hook system

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Controls the activation status of different hooks through the `hook.toggle.default` file

3. **Modular Hooks**
   - Each hook as an independent module for easier maintenance and extension

4. **Dynamic Loading**
   - Dynamically loads and executes hooks based on configuration

## Hook Types

This example contains several hook types:

1. **Basic Hooks**: a_hook, b_hook, c_hook
   - Demonstrates basic hook implementation

2. **Functional Hooks**: numpy_hook
   - Shows how to integrate third-party library functionality
